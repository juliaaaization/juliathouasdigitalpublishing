<h1>Humans 04 <a href="level-1-a.html">Manifesto</a></h1>

<h2>Animal rights is the movement to protect animals from being used or regarded as property by human beings.</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>It is a radical social movement insofar as it aims not only to attain more humane treatment for animals,</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but also to include species other than human beings within the moral community by giving their basic interests—for example,</p2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p3>the interest in avoiding suffering—the same consideration as those of human beings.</p3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p4>The claim is that animals should no longer be regarded legally or morally as property,
        or treated as resources for human purposes, but should instead be regarded as persons.</p4>
